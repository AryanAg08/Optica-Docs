# Attributes 

Attributes in HTML are additional pieces of information you can include within tags to modify or define the behavior or appearance of elements.

## Image Attributes

Sure, here are descriptions for the top 4 attributes used with the `<img>` tag:

1. **src (Source)**:
   - **Description**: This attribute is essential as it specifies the URL or file path to the image file that the `<img>` element should display.
   - **Usage**: It's mandatory and without it, the `<img>` tag won't display any image.
   - **Example**: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`

2. **alt (Alternative Text)**:
   - **Description**: Provides a textual description of the image. It's displayed if the image cannot be loaded or for accessibility purposes.
   - **Usage**: While not technically required, it's considered best practice for accessibility and SEO purposes.
   - **Example**: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">`

3. **width**:
   - **Description**: Specifies the width of the image in pixels.
   - **Usage**: This attribute allows you to control the size of the image displayed on the webpage.
   - **Example**: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" width="300">`

4. **height**:
   - **Description**: Specifies the height of the image in pixels.
   - **Usage**: Similar to the `width` attribute, `height` allows you to control the height of the image displayed on the webpage.
   - **Example**: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" height="200">`

These attributes are fundamental for displaying images on a webpage while ensuring accessibility and proper layout.
